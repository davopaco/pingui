# PINGUI üêß
An offline game created for teaching kids, within a basic foundation, how to properly use financial resources.

## Features
- **Main game levels:** Three game levels that vary on dynamics. These thre levels have one goal in common: grab what we call 'pigcoins' that will be used for the 'interlude levels' or side levels.
- **Side levels:** These are between the playthrough of the main levels. In these levels, the user has to spend the recollected pigcoins on different resources (i.e. groceries).
- **Cinematics:** Help explain the story of PINGUI. There's one final cinematic in which if the user doesn't have enough pigcoins, then this cinematic won't trigger.
- **Error and Information report:** Module created for allowing user to create messages and make comments about the game. These messages the get sent to a backend that proxies the message to an email already set.

## Technologies used
- **Gamemaker 2:** Cross-platform game engine for the game development.
- **GML:** Language used for creating the business logic and respective modules.
- **PHP:** For a backend server that implemented an SMTP library for using the SMTP server provided by Gmail.
