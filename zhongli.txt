To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Zhong Li. His gameplay is extremely subtle, 
and without a solid grasp of theoretical mathematics most of his skills will go over a typical gamer's head. 
There's also Zhong Li's outlook on humanity, which is deftly woven into his 
gameplay- his apparent uselessness in combat symbolizes him passing the torch 
onto the Liyue Qixing, for instance. Only real gamers understand this stuff; 
they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate that Zhong Li is 
not a DPS, and also to realise that he is also not a Support, 
Burster or Tank - that his true value lies outside of combat. As a consequence people who dislike Zhong Li truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Zhong Li's existential catchphrase "I will have order." 
which itself is a cryptic reference to the chaos he causes in both the story and on Reddit. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as miHoYo's genius wit unfolds itself on their smartphone screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚
And yes, by the way, I DO have a Zhong Li tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes
 only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
